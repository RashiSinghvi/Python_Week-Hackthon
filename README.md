# Python_Week-Hackthon
This Repository contains code of my model which I design for Python Week Hackathon(48 hours) held on 8th Jan to 10th Jan 


## Description
I name this project as "Chakshu" which means eyes,an eye of system.
This model capture image of people and check the match of the image from database and mark their attendance/presence along with their arrival time.
This project can be use in schools, hospitals, companies etc , it is helpful when more number of peoples are working together so it's very tedious task for anyone to mark the attendance manually for such a big crowd or staffs.
People have to stand in front of camera, so model can capture image of person.
