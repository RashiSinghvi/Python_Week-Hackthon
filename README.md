# Python_Week-Hackthon
This Repository contains code of my model which I design for Python Week Hackathon(48 hours) held on 8th Jan to 10th Jan <br>
Technology used: OpenCV, Python ,Face Recognition.


## Description
I name this project as "Chakshu" which means eyes,an eye of system.
This model capture image of people and check the match of the image from database and mark their attendance/presence along with their arrival time.
This project can be use in schools, hospitals, companies etc , it is helpful when more number of peoples are working together so it's very tedious task for anyone to mark the attendance manually for such a big crowd or staffs.
People have to stand in front of camera, so model can capture image of person.<br>

attendance.csv contains  name of staff along with their arrival time as their attendance record <br>
image folder contains all the images which treated a train images and these images is used for matching with current images <br>
attendance.py : it contain the python code for this project. <br>
